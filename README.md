# 🤖 AI-Powered PDF Question-Answering System (RAG)
### Intelligent, offline, context-aware Q&A from any PDF — No API, No Tokens Needed.

This project is a **fully offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that allows users to upload **one or multiple PDFs**, ask natural language questions, and receive **accurate, summarized answers** generated by a local AI model — without needing any external API, internet connection, or tokens.

Built with:
- **Streamlit** (Frontend UI)
- **FAISS** (Vector similarity search)
- **Sentence-Transformers** (PDF embeddings)
- **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** (Offline LLM for answer generation)
- **PyPDF2 / pdfplumber** (PDF text extraction)

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 100% Offline — No API, No Tokens  
All processing, embeddings, and AI generation happen locally using open-source models.

### 🔹 Multi-PDF Support  
Upload **one or multiple** PDFs — the app will automatically combine, chunk, embed, and index them.

### 🔹 Accurate RAG Answers  
System retrieves the **most relevant parts** of the PDF and generates **context-aware** answers.

### 🔹 Human-like Summaries & Explanations  
Not copy/paste — the model **explains concepts in simple, clean language**.

### 🔹 Clean, Professional UI  
Minimalistic, modern Streamlit interface suitable for demos and recruiter portfolio.

### 🔹 Clear History & Reset Options  
Delete only the question or wipe complete history using one-click controls.

## 🧠 How it Works (RAG Pipeline)

1. **Parse PDFs** using `pdfplumber` / `PyPDF2`
2. **Chunk text** into overlapping segments
3. **Generate embeddings** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
4. **Store & search** embeddings using **FAISS L2 index**
5. Retrieve top-k relevant chunks
6. Build a clean context-prompt
7. Generate answer using **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct**
8. Display final result + page references

## 📚 Example Questions

- *“Summarize the document in 5 lines.”*  
- *“Explain data privacy in simple words.”*  
- *“Who is the CEO of Infosys?”*  
- *“What are the key highlights of Section 3?”*  
- *“What does the report say about sustainability?”*

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Completely offline — unique advantage  
✔ Clean RAG architecture — good for ML portfolio  
✔ Recruiter-friendly design  
✔ Can be extended with LLaMA, Phi-3, Qwen, or other local LLMs  
✔ Works for **ANY** PDF — annual reports, HR docs, books, research papers
